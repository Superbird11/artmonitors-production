				<h1>Welcome to Monitors of Modern Art!</h1><br>
					<p class="indent">We of MOMA are pleased to welcome you to this gallery of colorful and
					inventive modern art. MOMA stands for equality among art â€“ we believe
					that all types of art are important and unique, and nothing should be
					denied the privilege of being called "art" just because it happens to
					be too "unique" or "different" from what traditionally makes up the
					medium. At MOMA, we present our own art, created in a unique style and
					attempting to dutifully represent the variety of the medium in a perhaps
					unconventional way, and we hope you will enjoy browsing our collection.</p>
					<p class="indent">We do our best to update our collection at least once every week, usually on Monday, with
					a new piece of Modern Art.</p>
				<h2>How our art is made</h2><br>
					<p class="indent">We at MOMA appreciate having
                    <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">fun with acronyms</a>
					and the title of our gallery is the foremost example. Indeed, the art
					displayed here is made from cracked monitor screens, hooked up to a
					testing program which displays a flat primary-color image. Photographs
					are taken and carefully edited to produce an artistic image that we and
					our viewers will enjoy looking at, and perhaps with complexities yet
					to be discovered and contemplated.</p><br>
				<h2>On collection titles</h2><br>
					<p class="indent">Our various collections are also given acronym titles, such as
					"OMA", "MAAT", "ROMA", and more. Some of these are meant to satire
					other significant titles with the same initials, but others are simply
					abbreviations. All are abbreviations for some title, and most of the
					time we attempt to make these titles representative of the contents of
					their collections. If you'd like to submit any suggestions, feel free
					to <a href="{% url 'artmonitors:view_contact' %}">contact us</a>!</p>

				<h2>Special Thanks</h2><br>
					<p class="indent">In particular, we would like to extend thanks to
                    <a href="http://www.kramden.org">the Kramden Institute</a>, without
                    which this project would not exist.</p>

				<h2>About The Curator</h2><br>
					<p class="indent">I (the curator) am currently a computer science
					student at university. If you're trying to find any of the
					miscellaneous personal projects I've hosted on this website,
                    <a href="{% url 'personal:index' %}">click here</a>.</p>
